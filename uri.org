* Goal of the program
 Generating functions are a powerful tool in combinatorics, providing a bridge between discrete structures and analytic methods. Here, we explore how generating functions encode sequences, allowing us to solve recurrence relations, count combinatorial objects, and analyze asymptotic behavior. Topics include ordinary and exponential generating functions, transformations and operations on generating functions, applications to counting problems, and connections to probability and number theory. 

* Timetable  

We meet on Colloquium-free Thursdays.
